# Text MultiClass Classification - RMDL: Random Multimodel Deep Learning

A jupyter notebook, Text classificaiton using RMDL-Random Multimodel Deep Learning

Random Multimodel Deep Learning is a new ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. RMDL solves the problem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to include text, video, images, and symbolic.

RMDL includes 3 Random models, oneDNN classifier at left, one Deep CNN classifier at middle, and one Deep RNN classifier at right (each unit could be LSTMor GRU)
